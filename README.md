# Welcome! 😎

As a front end developer who studied Cognitive Science at SFU, my goal is to combine cognition and computing to utilize an interdisciplinary approach to
improving user experiences on the web. 

From publishing a journal showcasing outstanding research papers to founding a conference and inspiring engineers to think about future technologies, my passion for technology brings me closer to that goal everyday.
